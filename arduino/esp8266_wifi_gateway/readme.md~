# ESP8266 WiFi nrf24l01 gateway

Connects to a WiFi AP, sends data received from nrf24l01 devices to an MQTT broker.

## Building

Requires espmake. The `libs` directory contains some required libraries. Some subdirs in `libs/RF24` needed to be deleted, because espmake tries to compile AVR code.

Run `espmake`.

## Installing

Run `espmake flash`
